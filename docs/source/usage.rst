Usage
=====

A .yaml config file of input variables can be found in ``user_inputs.yaml``.
This lists the variable names, their values and units in a dictionary.

Here you can input either the required sensitivity, or the integration time.
Both are set to zero by default.

After editing the config file and saving, running run.py will output the sensitivity or integration time, depending on the input.
