The AtLast Sensitivity Calculator can be user to calculate the required
exposure time to achieve a given sensitivity or, conversely, the sensitivity
obtained for a given exposure time.

About the Sensitivity Calculator
--------------------------------
More information about the sensitivity and integration time calculations is
provide :doc:`here <calculator_info/sensitivity>`. Information about the
parameters used by the calculator can be found
:doc:`here <calculator_info/calculation_inputs>`.

Installation and Usage
----------------------
The calculator is available both as a web-based application and as a standalone
Python package.

The web application allows you to provide input values to the calculator
directly to perform the sensitivity or integration time calculation.

Alternatively, you may install the Python package and incorporate the
calculator into your own code.

The :doc:`Installation Guide <user_guide/installation>` provides
detailed instructions on how to set up the web client or install the Python
package.
