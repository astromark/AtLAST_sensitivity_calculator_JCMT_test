The AtLast Sensitivity Calculator can be used to calculate the required
exposure time to achieve a given sensitivity or, conversely, the sensitivity
obtained for a given exposure time.

About the Sensitivity Calculator
--------------------------------
The sensitivity calculator presented here will calculate either the sensitivity of the telescope, given an input on-source integration time, or the on-source integration time required to achieve the requested sensitivity. 

More information on the calculation done within the sensitivity calculator can be found in section 2.1. A description of the parameters used as input for these calculations is is presented in section 2.2, which also shows which telescope properties are derived from those user inputs. An overview of how to use the weather package *am* can be found in section 2.3

Sections 2.4 and 2.5 talk about how to install and run the python version of the calculator, with section 2.6 describing the formatting of the input files that will work with the command line or python version of the calculator. Section 2.7 describes using the web front-end.

Sections 2.8 through to 2.13 describe in more detail how the package was constructed, tested, how the front and back end components interact with each other, and how the code can be extended by developers.

Installation and Usage
----------------------
The calculator is available both as a web-based application and as a standalone
Python package.

The :doc:`Installation Guide <user_guide/python_package_installation>` provides
detailed instructions on how to install the Python
package.

See :doc:`Using the Calculator <user_guide/using_the_calculator>` for information
on how to integrate the calculator into your Python code.

For information on running the web client, see
:doc:`Running the Web Client <user_guide/running_the_web_client>`.
