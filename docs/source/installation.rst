To install the package the necessary steps are:

Further documentation, including a ``User Guide`` can be found in the 
``docs`` folder. To build the html version of the documentation, start 
from the ``AtLAST_sensitivity_calculator`` directory and type ``cd docs; make html``.
Read the documentation by pointing your browser
