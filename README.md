Background
==========

The AtLast Sensitivity Calculator can be used to calculate the required
exposure time to achieve a given sensitivity or, conversely, the sensitivity
obtained for a given exposure time.

Using the Sensitivity Calculator
================================
The calculator is available as both a web-based application and as a Python 
package. For future releases, both will be hosted on publicly available servers.

For the time being, both the web client and Python package can be installed or
downloaded from this repository.

Documentation on how to install the Sensitivity Calculator Python package can be found
in the [``Python Package Installation Guide``](docs/source/user_guide/python_package_installation.rst). Information
on using the Python package is provided in the [``Using the Calculator guide``](docs/source/user_guide/using_the_calculator.rst).

See [``Running the Web Client``](docs/source/user_guide/running_the_web_client.rst) for instructions on
setting up the Sensitivity Calculator web application.


Guide for Developers
====================
Information on setting up your development environment, building, running, and deploying the application, running tests,
and generating the docs is provided in the [``Developing the application guide``](docs/source/developer_guide/developing_the_application.rst).

An overview of the application is provided [``here``](docs/source/developer_guide/application_overview.rst).

Information about the structure of the repository can be found [``here``](docs/source/developer_guide/repository_overview.rst).
