Background
==========

The AtLast Sensitivity Calculator can be used to calculate the required
exposure time to achieve a given sensitivity or, conversely, the sensitivity
obtained for a given exposure time.

Using the Sensitivity Calculator
================================
The calculator is available as both a web-based application and as a Python 
package. For future releases, both will be hosted on publicly available servers.

For the time being, both the web client and Python package can be installed or
downloaded from this repository.

Documentation on how to install and use the Sensitivity Calculater can be found
in the [``Installation Guide``](docs/source/user_guide/installation.rst).


Guide for Developers
====================
Information on setting up your development environment, building, running, and deploying the application, running tests,
and generating the docs is provided in the [``Guide for Developers``](docs/source/developer_guide/guide_for_developers.rst).
